# TGH-5.0

## Start Here

1. Make sure to have the following dependancies installed : `pygame, streamlit, dotenv, openai, configparser`
2. Create a `.env` file and place the following into it : **OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"** #replace YOUR_API_KEY with your OpenAI API key
3. That's it! Run main.py (python3 main.py in the terminal) and the game will start right up.
